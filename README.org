Daunted by a large codebase? Lost in a myriad of wrappers and callbacks? These are worries of the past! With *traverse.el* you can map out your path through the codebase like a 16-th century pioneer!

To use it, simply open up a project and enable the minor mode: =M-x traverse-mode=.

Now jump around the code (back and forth) using =xref-find-definitions= and =xref-go-back=. As you navigate, *traverse-mode* will map out the routes you take (/NOTE: Internally, the so-called "map" is represented as a graph/)!

To view the map press: =M-x traverse-toggle-graph-visualization=.

** Installation

Clone this repo and =M-x load-file traverse.el=.

** Tests

The testing suite can be found in _traverse-tests.el_.

To run the tests for this package, run:

#+begin_src shell
  emacs --batch --load ./traverse-tests.el --funcall ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
#+end_src
